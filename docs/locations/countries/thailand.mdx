# ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Thailand

Thailand's cuisine is as diverse as its geography, with each region developing distinct flavors shaped by climate, neighboring cultures, and local ingredients. From the refined royal cuisine of Bangkok to the fiery dishes of Isaan and the coconut-rich curries of the South, Thai food offers endless exploration.

## The Four Culinary Regions

- River fish and freshwater ingredients

### [Northern Thailand (Lanna Kingdom)](/locations/thailand/chiang-mai)
The mountainous north with cooler climate and strong Burmese, Shan, and Chinese influences. Sticky rice (khao niao) replaces jasmine rice.
