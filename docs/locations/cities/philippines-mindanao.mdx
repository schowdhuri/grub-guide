Mindanao, the southernmost major island of the Philippines, has a distinct culinary identity shaped by its Muslim population, indigenous tribes, and unique geography. The region's food culture differs significantly from the heavily Spanish-influenced north, maintaining more indigenous and Islamic traditions.

**Indigenous Tribes**: Native cooking methods preserved
**Less Spanish Influence**: More distinctly Southeast Asian flavors
**Unique Spices**: Different spice combinations than Luzon and Visayas

## Signature Dishes
