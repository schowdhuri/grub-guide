# Chiang Mai

Chiang Mai, the cultural heart of Northern Thailand, offers a cuisine distinct from Bangkok's more familiar dishes. The cooler mountain climate, Burmese and Shan influences, and the prominence of sticky rice over jasmine rice create a unique culinary identity.

## Lanna Cuisine Characteristics

- **Sticky Rice (Khao Niao)**: The staple, eaten with every meal
- **Milder Flavors**: Less chili, more herbs
- **Burmese Influence**: Curries and fermented soybeans
- **Unique Sausages**: Sai ua (herb sausage), sai krok (fermented)
- **Forest Vegetables**: Bitter greens and wild herbs

## Signature Dishes

Khao soi (curry noodle soup), nam prik noom (green chili dip), and sai ua are Northern specialties rarely found authentic elsewhere in Thailand.
