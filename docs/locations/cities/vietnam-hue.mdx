# Huế & Central Vietnam

Huế, Vietnam's imperial capital from 1802-1945, developed the country's most sophisticated and elaborate cuisine. The royal court's culinary traditions emphasized presentation, complexity, and refinement - creating dishes meant to impress emperors.

## Imperial Cuisine Legacy

- **Small Portions**: Many courses rather than large plates
- **Elaborate Presentation**: Artistic arrangements
- **Complex Preparations**: Multi-step cooking processes
- **Spicier**: More chili than other regions
- **Buddhist Influence**: Sophisticated vegetarian dishes

## Royal Traditions

Huế's cuisine was designed for royalty - small, beautiful portions meant to be savored slowly over many courses. This tradition continues in the city's restaurants.

## Signature Dishes

**Bún Bò Huế**: Spicy beef noodle soup, more complex than phở
