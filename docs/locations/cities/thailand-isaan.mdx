# Isaan Region

The Isaan region of Northeastern Thailand has the most culturally distinct cuisine in the country. Sharing more with Laos than Central Thailand, Isaan food is characterized by extreme spice levels, fermented fish, grilled meats, and sticky rice as the foundation of every meal.

## Defining Characteristics

- **Extremely Spicy**: The hottest Thai regional cuisine
- **Sticky Rice**: Khao niao is the staple carbohydrate
- **Pla Ra**: Fermented fish sauce (stronger than regular fish sauce)
- **Grilled Meats**: Gai yang (chicken), moo yang (pork)
- **Raw Preparations**: Koi (raw meat salads), considered delicacies

## Signature Flavors

Som tam (papaya salad), larb (spicy meat salad), and grilled chicken are Isaan's gifts to Thai cuisine, now popular nationwide but best in their homeland.
