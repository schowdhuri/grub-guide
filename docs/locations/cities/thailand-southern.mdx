# Southern Thailand

Southern Thailand, stretching down the long peninsula to Malaysia, has a cuisine shaped by tropical abundance, two coastlines (Andaman Sea and Gulf of Thailand), rubber plantations, and strong Muslim influence from neighboring Malaysia.

## Regional Characteristics

- **Spiciest Region**: Even hotter than Isaan
- **Coconut Everything**: Milk, cream, oil, and fresh coconut
- **Abundant Seafood**: Two coasts provide diverse catches
- **Turmeric & Dried Spices**: More than fresh herbs
- **Muslim Influence**: Halal preparations, roti, curries

## Unique Ingredients

The South uses ingredients rarely seen in other regions - turmeric (fresh and dried), stink beans, and an abundance of seafood prepared in unique ways.
