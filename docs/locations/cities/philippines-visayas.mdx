# Visayas (Cebu, Iloilo, Bacolod)

The Visayan islands in central Philippines are renowned for perfecting the balance of sweet and savory, and for producing what many consider the country's best lechon. The region's proximity to the sea ensures abundant seafood, while sugarcane plantations influence the sweeter flavor profiles.

## Regional Characteristics

**Cebu**: Lechon capital with crispy, flavorful roasted pig
**Iloilo**: Home of la paz batchoy and pancit molo
**Bacolod**: Known for chicken inasal (marinated grilled chicken)

## Signature Preparations

- **Sweet-Savory Balance**: More sugar than northern regions
- **Grilling Traditions**: Charcoal-grilled meats with unique marinades
- **Seafood Excellence**: Fresh catches from surrounding seas
- **Humba**: The Visayan version of braised pork, sweeter than Luzon's
