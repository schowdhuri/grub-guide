# Welcome to Global Grub Guide 🍜🌍

Welcome to my personal food documentation project! As a foodie, traveler, photographer, software engineer and compulsive note taker, I want to meticulously document and track all the amazing foods I eat as I travel the world.

## About This Project

This site chronicles my culinary adventures across the countries I've visited, featuring authentic dishes, personal experiences, and cultural insights. Each food entry includes:

- **Cultural significance** and history
- **Authentic ingredients** and preparation methods
- **Personal photos** and experiences
- **Recipe links** to authentic sources
- **Location details** with embedded maps
- **Personal ratings** and tasting notes

## Countries I've Explored

import { CountryStats } from '@site/src/components/CountryStats';

## Featured Cuisines

### 🇹🇭 Thailand
Home to incredible flavors like **khao kha moo** (braised pork leg rice) and **tom yum goong** (hot & sour shrimp soup). Thai cuisine perfectly balances sweet, sour, salty, spicy, and bitter flavors.

### 🇻🇳 Vietnam
Fresh, herbaceous dishes like **bun cha** (grilled pork with noodles) and **my quang** (turmeric noodle soup) showcase Vietnam's focus on balance and freshness.

### 🇲🇾 Malaysia
A melting pot of flavors, featuring dishes like **nasi lemak** (coconut rice with accompaniments) that reflect the country's diverse cultural heritage.
