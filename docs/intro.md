# Welcome to Global Grub Guide üçúüåç

Welcome to my personal food documentation project! This site chronicles my culinary adventures across the countries I've visited, featuring authentic dishes, personal experiences, and cultural insights. Each food entry includes:

- **Cultural significance** and history
- **Authentic ingredients** and preparation methods
- **Personal photos** and experiences
- **Recipe links** to authentic sources
- **Location details** with embedded maps
- **Personal ratings** and tasting notes

## How to Navigate

- **Browse by Country**: Explore the sidebar to dive deep into specific cuisines
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific dishes or ingredients
- **Filter**: Use tags to find dishes by type, spice level, or dietary preferences

## Growing Collection

This is a living document that grows with each travel adventure. While I start with placeholder images, I'll gradually replace them with my personal photos and add new discoveries from future travels.

Start exploring by selecting a country or cuisine from the sidebar, or dive right into my favorites in Thailand! üå∂Ô∏è
