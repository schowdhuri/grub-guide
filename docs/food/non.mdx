## More Than Bread - A Cultural Symbol

**Essential Daily Bread**: Non or nan is the traditional bread of Uzbekistan, and it is baked in a **tandyr oven** (similar to a tandoor oven). Tandyr nan is a type of Central Asian bread cooked in a vertical clay oven, circular and leavened with yeast, and typically has a **crisp golden surface**.

**The Chekich Stamp**: The most distinctive feature is its decorative pattern created by a special tool. This design is created with a stamp known as a **chekich**. Chekich have wooden handles into which metal nails have been inserted in patterns—each bakery creating signature designs.

**Practical and Aesthetic**: The chekich serves both purposes. It gives each bakery's nan a distinct design, and the holes created allow **steam to rise from the flattened interior part** of the nan, preventing the center from puffing up during baking.

**Cultural Importance**: In Uzbek culture, non has great cultural importance and is used in many ceremonies marking phases of life, with **newborn babies having non placed under their heads to symbolize long life**.

_Non represents the soul of Uzbek hospitality—break bread together, share this sacred circle, participate in millennia of tradition. No meal is complete without non's presence on the dastarkhan._
