### First Encounter
[Personal experience placeholder - to be filled with your specific memories and impressions]

### Personal Notes
- The sweetness should balance, not overpower the pork flavors
- Slow cooking is essential for tender, fall-apart pork
- Best served with plain rice to balance the rich, sweet sauce
- The dish improves significantly when reheated the next day

### Cultural Context
Eating Humba connects to **Visayan cultural identity**‚Äîrepresenting regional pride, Chinese-Filipino heritage, and the distinctive sweet-savory balance that characterizes Cebuano cuisine.

## Cooking Technique & Mastery

**Slow Braising**: Humba requires **long, gentle cooking**‚Äîallowing the pork to become tender while the sauce reduces to a glossy, concentrated consistency that coats the meat.

**Balance Achievement**: Master cooks achieve perfect **sweet-salty-sour harmony**‚Äîadjusting sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar throughout cooking to create complex flavors without any single element dominating.

## Regional Variations & Styles

**Cebu Classic**: Traditional version with pork belly, brown sugar, soy sauce, and bay leaves
**Bohol Style**: Often includes more vegetables and local ingredients
**Negros Version**: May use local muscovado sugar for deeper sweetness
**Modern Adaptations**: Some include pineapple, star anise, or other aromatics

### Traditional Additions
- **Banana blossoms** - Classic Visayan vegetable
- **Hard-boiled eggs** - Protein and visual appeal
- **Dried shiitake mushrooms** - Chinese influence
- **Black beans (tausi)** - Umami depth from Chinese tradition
