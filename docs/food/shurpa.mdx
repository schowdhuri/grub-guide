## The Perfect Clear Broth

**Traditional Preparation**: Real Uzbek shurpa is made from **lamb (flesh on the bones and ribs)**, vegetable oil, carrots, onions, potatoes, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, bay leaf, and greens. The soup is a broth made with generous pieces of lamb and an assortment of vegetables.

**Clarity is Key**: The soup has to simmer and slowly cook for a lengthy period of time, and **the broth should be clear**. It's important not to over-boil‚Äîthe heat should remain on medium most of the time because shurpa needs to **simmer and cook slowly** to get its rich, dense texture.

**Regional Variations**: In Uzbekistan, there are three different variations‚Äîthe most popular is **kaynatma shurpa**, containing meat broth and boiled vegetables where ingredients are only boiled, not fried, while **kovurma shurpa** has fried ingredients and is greasier.
