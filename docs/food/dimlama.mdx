## Layered Perfection

**Seasonal Special**: Dimlama is a robust one-pot stew typically associated with **harvest time in Uzbekistan**. If you're in Uzbekistan in the spring or fall, you'll certainly encounter dimlama as a seasonal special.

**Simple Technique**: To prepare dimlama, the ingredients are quite simply **layered in a deep pan** that is covered and simmered for several hours. The layering creates distinct flavors that meld during long, slow cooking.
