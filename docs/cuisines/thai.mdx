# ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­ Thai Cuisine

Thai cuisine is celebrated worldwide for its complex flavors, aromatic herbs, and perfect balance of the four fundamental tastes: sweet, sour, salty, and spicy. Every dish is a carefully orchestrated symphony of flavors that awaken all the senses.

## The Art of Balance

Thai cooking is built on the principle of **à¹€à¸ªà¹‰à¸™à¸—à¸²à¸‡** (sen thang) - the path of balance. No single flavor dominates; instead, each element complements and enhances the others. A squeeze of lime balances the richness of coconut milk, while palm sugar tempers the heat of chilies.

## Essential Ingredients

- **Holy Trinity**: Garlic, chilies, and shallots form the base of most dishes
- **Aromatic Herbs**: Lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves, Thai basil, cilantro
- **Fish Sauce (Nam Pla)**: The umami backbone of Thai cooking
- **Coconut Milk**: Provides richness to curries and desserts
- **Palm Sugar**: Adds subtle sweetness and depth

## Key Flavor Profiles

**Curries (Gaeng)**: From the fiery red to the mild yellow and fragrant green
**Stir-Fries (Pad)**: Quick-cooked with high heat and bold seasonings
**Soups (Tom)**: Clear, spicy broths or creamy coconut bases
**Salads (Yam)**: Spicy, tangy compositions with fresh herbs

## Regional Styles

### Central Thailand (Bangkok)

### Northern Thailand (Lanna)

### Northeastern Thailand (Isaan)

## Dining Culture

Thai meals are communal affairs where multiple dishes are shared. Rice (khao) is the center, with dishes eaten **gap khao** (with rice). Street food culture is vibrant, with vendors specializing in single dishes perfected over generations.
