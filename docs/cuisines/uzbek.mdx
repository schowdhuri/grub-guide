# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¿ Uzbek Cuisine

Uzbek cuisine is a treasure of Central Asian cooking, shaped by centuries of Silk Road trade and nomadic traditions. Hearty, flavorful, and deeply rooted in hospitality, Uzbek food reflects the soul of a nation that has welcomed travelers for millennia.

## Silk Road Heritage

Positioned at the crossroads of Asia, Uzbek cuisine absorbed influences from Persian, Turkish, Mongolian, Russian, and Chinese culinary traditions. Yet it maintained its unique identity through distinctive techniques and flavor combinations.

## Core Philosophy

Uzbek cooking celebrates abundance and generosity. Meals are lavish affairs meant for sharing, with **plov** (pilaf) at the heart of celebrations. Bread (**non**) is sacred - never placed upside down or thrown away.

## Essential Elements

- **Lamb & Mutton**: The primary protein, valued for flavor and cultural significance
- **Tandyr Cooking**: Traditional clay ovens for bread, kebabs, and roasts
- **Cumin & Coriander**: The signature spice combination
- **Fresh Herbs**: Dill, cilantro, parsley used generously
- **Fermented Dairy**: Yogurt, sour cream, and cultured milk products

## Signature Dishes

**Plov (Osh)**: The king of Uzbek cuisine - saffron rice with meat, carrots, and chickpeas
**Non**: Traditional flatbread stamped with decorative patterns
**Lagman**: Hand-pulled noodles in rich meat broth
**Somsa**: Flaky pastries filled with meat and onions
**Shashlik**: Marinated grilled lamb on skewers

## Regional Variations

### Samarkand

### Bukhara

## Dining Customs

Meals begin with tea and sweets, followed by salads, main courses, and end with more tea. Guests are seated by importance around the **dastarkhan** (tablecloth). Eating with hands from a communal plate is traditional.

## The Plov Ceremony

Uzbek plov isn't just a dish - it's a ritual. Traditionally cooked by men in huge cast-iron cauldrons (**kazan**), often serving hundreds at weddings and celebrations. Each region has its own plov variation.
